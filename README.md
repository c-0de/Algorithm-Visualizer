Developed a suite of applications aimed at visualizing various algorithms to aid in understanding their behaviors and implementations.

The first application focused on pathfinding algorithms and was built using React.js.
It provided an interactive platform where users could observe the processes of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm in action.
These algorithms were implemented to find the shortest path between two points (except for DFS) on a grid. Users can input their desired starting and ending points, 
and the application will animate the algorithm's execution, visually demonstrating how each algorithm explored and determined the optimal path.

The second application is on sorting algorithms and was also developed using React.js.
It offered a hands-on experience for users to witness the workings of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort.

Lastly, created an application focused on searching algorithms, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This application allowes users to explore algorithms like linear search and binary search interactively.
